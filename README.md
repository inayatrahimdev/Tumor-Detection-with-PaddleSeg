# Tumor-Detection-with-PaddleSeg: Medical AI for Lung Tumor Detection

**Tumor-Detection-with-PaddleSeg** is a high-precision medical imaging framework designed for the semantic segmentation and classification of lung tumors using radiological scans, including chest X-rays and CT slices. The system integrates deep learning models for dense pixel-wise segmentation (via PaddleSeg) and lesion-level classification (via PaddleClas), optimized for research, clinical aid, and medical data annotation tasks.

---

## Project Scope

The objective oF Tumor-Detection-with-PaddleSeg is to deliver an interpretable, modular, and open framework for analyzing thoracic radiology datasets. The system enables physicians, researchers, and healthcare providers to automatically segment tumor regions, predict malignancy likelihood, and assist in screening workflows for pulmonary disease.

## Capabilities

- **Pixel-Level Tumor Segmentation**
- **Multi-Class Lesion Classification (Benign, Malignant, Uncertain)**
- **Heatmap Visualization for Region Importance**
- **Cross-Modality Compatibility (X-ray, CT, PNG, DICOM)**
- **Overlay & Comparison of Annotated and Predicted Masks**
- **Support for Multiphase CT Volumes**
